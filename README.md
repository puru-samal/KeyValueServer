# KeyValueServer

## Setting up Go

You can download and install Go for your operating system from [the official site](https://golang.org/doc/install).
**Tested with Go version 1.23.**

## A key-value messaging system

This repository contains the code for a key-value messaging system implementation. It also contains the tests to test my implementation and an example 'server runner' binary useful for testing purposes.

### Specifications

- The server manages and interacts with its clients concurrently using Goroutines and channels. Multiple clients should be able to connect/disconnect to the server simultaneously.

- When a client wants to put a value into the server, it sends the following request string: `Put:key:value`. When a client wants to get a value from the server, it sends the following request string: `Get:key`. When a client wants to delete a key from the server, it sends the following request string: `Delete:key`. When a client wants to update an oldValue with a newValue for a given key, it sends the following request string `Update:key:oldValue:newValue`. These are the only possible messages acceptable from the client.

- When the server reads a `Get()` request message from a client, it responds with the following string: `key:value[newline]` to the client that sent the message. It sends this string once for every value associated with the given key. No response is sent for a `Put()` request, a `Delete()` request, or an `Update()` request.

- Every message that is sent or received should be terminated by the newline (\n) character.

- The server implements a CountActive() function that returns the number of clients that are currently connected to it.

- The server implements a CountDropped() function that returns the number of clients that have been disconnected from and thus dropped from the server.

- The server is responsive to slow-reading clients. To better understand what this means, consider a scenario in which a client does not call Read for an extended period of time. If during this time the server continues to write messages to the clientâ€™s TCP connection, eventually the TCP connections output buffer will reach maximum capacity and subsequent calls to Write made by the server will block. To handle these cases, the server keeps a queue of at most 500 outgoing messages to be written to the client at a later time. Messages sent to a slow-reading client whose outgoing message buffer has reached the maximum capacity of 500 are simply dropped. If the slow-reading client starts reading again in the future, the server ensures that any buffered messages in its queue are written back to the client. A buffered channel is used to implement this properly.

The below `go test` commands should work out-of-the-box.

### Running the official tests

To test execute the following command from inside the `src/github.com/puru/server` directory:

```sh
$ go test
```

You can also check the code for race conditions using Go's race detector by executing
the following command:

```sh
$ go test -race
```

To execute a single unit test, you can use the `-test.run` flag and specify a regular expression
identifying the name of the test to run. For example,

```sh
$ go test -race -test.run TestBasic1
```

### Using `srunner`

The repository also contains a a simple `srunner` (server runner)
program that you can use to create and start an instance of the `KeyValueServer`. The program
simply creates an instance of the server, starts it on a default port, and blocks forever,
running the server in the background.

To compile and build the `srunner` program into a binary that you can run, execute the
command below from within the `src/github.com/cmu440/` directory:

```bash
$ go install github.com/cmu440/srunner
```

Then you can run the `srunner` binary from anywhere by executing:

```bash
$ $HOME/go/bin/srunner
```

(`$HOME/go/bin` is Go's default destination for `go install`'d binaries. If the command fails or you want to change the install directory, see the options [here](https://go.dev/doc/code#Command).)

You can test the server using Netcat (i.e. run the `srunner` binary in the background, execute `nc localhost 9999`, type the message you wish to send, and then
hit enter). You can get more information on how to use netcat using the man pages (`man nc`).
